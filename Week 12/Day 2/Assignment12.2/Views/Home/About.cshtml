        <h5>We sell books now.</h5>
        <div class="h-30"></div>
        <p>Since its foundation in 1995 by David Russ, Box has held fast to its early vision, best described by the most consistent comment heard from our ever appearing new visitors... “Didn't you used sell art?”</p>

        <p>Yes.</p>

        <p>But now, Box buys and sells books which, by nature of their significance and scarcity, have obtained a desirability and value concomitant to that prominence. Trained to trade within a diverse 
            range of subject matter, we endeavor to employ our skills to the benefit of our present and future clients.</p>
