WEEK 1:

	Assignment 1.1 - 
    	1. Create a simple console application and store your name, age (should take decimal), 
	address in a string variable and print them back on console.
   		2. Create a simple console application and declare basic datatypes like int, float, decimal,
		double and print their min and	max values.
	Assignment 1.2 -
		1. Write a simple application to perform calculation functions. Call them appropriately when user
		selects the proper menu.
		2. Write a C# Sharp program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.
		3. Write a C# Sharp program to find the sum of first 10 natural numbers.
	Assignment 1.3 - 
		1. Write a program in C# to calculate area of triangle, square and rectangle. Write 3 different
		functions for each shape .
		to take dimensions of figure and display the area. You may create menus.
		2. Write a program in C# to read n number of values in an array and display it in reverse order.
		3. Write a program to sort an integer array in ascending and descending order. Array can be
		created with hard coded values.
	Assignment 1.3.1 -
		1. Write a simple console application to generate mathematical errors and handle them by exception
		handling.
		2. Use debugging tools in Visual studio.
	Assignment 1.4 -
		1. Create a structure named “Point” and 2 data members: X and Y coordinate. Declare 2 points: P1
		and P2. Determine if P2 is to the right or left of P1 or on same axis , by comparing the x
		coordinates. (if p1.x is more than p2.x , it is to the right)
		2. Write a class: “Student” with private data members: StudentId ( int), StudentFname (stirng),
		StudentLname (string ), StudentGrade ( char ) and public properties for each data member. 
		Instantiate the class and assign data to properties.call get and set properties.

WEEK 2:

	Assignment 2.1 -
		1. Write a base class: ‘Shape’ and add properties like id, name and color and method like 
		‘calculate area’ . Inherit circle shape from base class and add properties like radius. override 
		calculate area logic for circle. Inherit square class from shape and add change the calculate area
		logic. Add property like side of square. Take the input from user to select circle or square and 
		display the calculated area . no hard coded values!
		2. Design a class hierarchy of your choice.
	Assignment 2.2 -
		1. Write a console application to create a text file and save your basic details like name, age,
		address ( use dummy data). Read the details from same file and print on console.
		2. Design a tip calculator : enter the bill total, tip % and display grand total after adding tip.
		Use the format specifiers to display currency, % symbol.
		
WEEK 3: SQL Training, completed in virtual machine labs.

WEEK 4:

	Assignment 4.1 -
		1. Return even numbers. Write a method that returns a string of even numbers greater than 0 and 
		less than 100.
		2. If year is leap. Given a year as integer, write a method that checks if year is leap.
		3. String in reverse order. Given a string, write a method that returns that string in reverse 
		order.
		4. Write a program in C# Sharp to create a function to input a string and count number of spaces
		are in the string.
	Assignment 4.2 -
		1. Create a 2D array to store integers and print them in matrix format with proper formatting.
		2. Write a program in C# Sharp for addition of two Matrices of same size.
		3. Create a console application to create following overloaded methods:
			Int Add(int a, int b) , int Add(int a,int b, int c)
			float Multiply(float a, float b), float Multiply(float a , float b, float c)
			Call the above methods by providing a menu to user.
		4. Create a console application to overload “+” and “-“ operator for adding the areas of 2 circles
		and getting their area difference respectively.
	Assignment 4.3 -
		1. Windows form assignment: Use different controls on windows forms and change their properties.
		2. Create a structure : Student with fields like studid, firstname, lastname, address,
		monthofadmission,grade .: A, B,C. Create a list of students and perform following operations in
		windows application: Add new records, delete record and display them in grid. Monthofadmission 
		should be enum.
	Assignment 4.4 -
		1. Events, delegates:
		Create a windows form application to display bank account details. Create an event for low balance
		and as soon as balance goes lower than 200, notify by raising the low balance event. Use delegates.
		2. Organizing data into collections:
		Create an abstract base class to represent “Beverage” and inherit “Coffee” class from it. Create a
		generic list ( you may use Dictionary/Sortedlist) of coffees. Design windows form application to
		display the list of coffees in grid and perform	add/ delete.
